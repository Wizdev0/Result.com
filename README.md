## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Quaries
 


### What I learned

I learnt how to use media quaries and how to set my my project to differnt device width


```css 
@media only screen and (max-width:600px){
    .container{
        display: block;
    }

    .result-card{
        width: 100%;
        margin: 0;
    }

    .summary-item{
        width: 100%;
    }

    .label{
        margin-left: -30%;
    }
}
```



### Continued development

I am going to explore more on media queries especially for monile device like tablets, bigger phones, Ipad, etc

### Useful resources

- [ChatGpt](https://chat.openai.com) - This AI model really helped me a lot when I was on the project, it helped me to Write the code in an orderly manner and also helped me to remember certain things I can recall.
